## Overview

SCANUE v22 represents the next generation of multi-agent workflow systems, designed to handle complex cognitive tasks through sophisticated agent orchestration and human-in-the-loop interactions.

## System Architecture

The system is built on several key components:

### Multi-Agent Framework
- **Base Agent**: Core agent functionality and common interfaces
- **DLPFC Agent**: Specialized agent for executive functions and cognitive control
- **Specialized Agents**: Task-specific agents optimized for particular domains

### Workflow Engine
- **LangGraph Integration**: Advanced workflow orchestration with state management
- **Conditional Routing**: Dynamic task allocation based on context and requirements
- **State Management**: Persistent state across workflow executions

### Human-in-the-Loop Integration
- **Interactive Decision Points**: Strategic placement of human feedback opportunities
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Seamless integration of human expertise
- **Feedback Learning**: System adaptation based on human input

## Key Features

### Advanced Agent Coordination
The system employs sophisticated coordination mechanisms that allow multiple agents to work together efficiently, sharing information and resources while maintaining their specialized functions.

### Flexible Workflow Design
Built on LangGraph, the workflow engine supports complex routing logic, conditional execution, and dynamic adaptation to changing requirements.

### Comprehensive Testing
The system includes extensive test coverage across all components, ensuring reliability and maintainability.

### Debug and Monitoring Tools
Comprehensive debugging utilities help developers understand system behavior and optimize performance.

## Technical Specifications

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Framework**: LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- **Testing**: pytest framework with comprehensive test coverage
- **Architecture**: Modular, agent-based design
- **Integration**: Human-in-the-loop capabilities
