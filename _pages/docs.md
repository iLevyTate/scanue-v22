## Code Examples

### Basic Workflow
```python

from agents.base import BaseAgent

# Initialize workflow
workflow = SCANUEWorkflow()

# Add agents
agent = BaseAgent(name="example_agent")
workflow.add_agent(agent)

# Execute workflow
result = workflow.execute(input_data)
```

### Custom Agent
```python
from agents.base import BaseAgent

class CustomAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, name="custom_agent"):
        super().__init__(name)
    
    def process(self, input_data):
        # Custom processing logic
        return self.enhanced_processing(input_data)
```

### Human-in-the-Loop Integration
```python
from workflow import SCANUEWorkflow
from debug.demonstrate_hitl import setup_hitl_workflow

# Setup HITL workflow
workflow = setup_hitl_workflow()

# Execute with human feedback points
result = workflow.execute_with_feedback(input_data)
```
