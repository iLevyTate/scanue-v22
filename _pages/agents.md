## Overview

SCANUE v22 employs a sophisticated multi-agent architecture where different agents specialize in specific cognitive functions. This design enables efficient task distribution and leverages the strengths of each agent type.

## Base Agent

The foundation of all agents in the system, providing core functionality and common interfaces.

### Features
- **Common Interface**: Standardized methods for agent communication
- **State Management**: Persistent state handling across interactions
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and recovery
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### Usage
```python
from agents.base import BaseAgent

agent = BaseAgent(name="base_agent")
result = agent.process(input_data)
```

## DLPFC Agent

The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) agent specializes in executive functions and cognitive control, mimicking the cognitive processes of the human prefrontal cortex.

### Capabilities
- **Executive Control**: High-level decision making and task coordination
- **Working Memory**: Temporary information storage and manipulation
- **Cognitive Flexibility**: Adapting strategies based on context
- **Attention Management**: Focusing on relevant information

### Specialized Functions
- Strategic planning and goal management
- Conflict monitoring and resolution
- Abstract reasoning and problem-solving
- Multi-tasking coordination

### Usage
```python
from agents.dlpfc import DLPFCAgent

dlpfc_agent = DLPFCAgent(name="executive_agent")
strategic_plan = dlpfc_agent.create_strategy(problem_context)
decision = dlpfc_agent.make_executive_decision(options)
```

## Specialized Agents

Task-specific agents optimized for particular domains or functions.

### Design Principles
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep specialization in specific areas
- **Efficient Processing**: Optimized algorithms for target tasks
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with other agents
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle varying workloads

### Implementation Example
```python
from agents.specialized import SpecializedAgent

class AnalysisAgent(SpecializedAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="analysis_agent")
        self.specialty = "data_analysis"
    
    def analyze_data(self, dataset):
        # Specialized analysis logic
        return self.perform_analysis(dataset)
```

## Agent Coordination

### Communication Patterns
- **Direct Messaging**: Point-to-point communication between agents
- **Broadcast Messages**: One-to-many communication for coordination
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Reactive communication based on system events

### Workflow Integration
Agents are seamlessly integrated into the LangGraph workflow engine, allowing for:
- Dynamic agent selection based on task requirements
- Parallel agent execution for improved performance
- Sequential agent chaining for complex processing pipelines

### Example Coordination
```python
from workflow import SCANUEWorkflow
from agents.dlpfc import DLPFCAgent
from agents.specialized import SpecializedAgent

workflow = SCANUEWorkflow()

# Add coordinated agents
executive_agent = DLPFCAgent(name="executive")
analysis_agent = SpecializedAgent(name="analyzer")

workflow.add_agent_chain([executive_agent, analysis_agent])
```

## Human-Agent Interaction

### Interactive Decision Points
Agents can request human input at critical decision points, ensuring that human expertise is leveraged when needed.

### Feedback Learning
Agents adapt their behavior based on human feedback, improving performance over time.

### Collaboration Modes
- **Advisory Mode**: Agents provide recommendations for human decision-making
- **Supervisory Mode**: Humans oversee agent actions with intervention capabilities
- **Collaborative Mode**: Real-time collaboration between humans and agents

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Collection
- **Response Time**: Agent processing duration
- **Accuracy**: Task completion success rates
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU utilization
- **Interaction Quality**: Human feedback scores

### Optimization Strategies
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing tasks across available agents
- **Caching**: Storing frequently accessed data for faster retrieval
- **Model Fine-tuning**: Adjusting agent parameters based on performance data

## Testing and Validation

Each agent type includes comprehensive test coverage:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual agent functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Agent interaction and coordination
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Behavioral Tests**: Validation of cognitive functions
